### In this Project we create a webpage where you can simulate lift mechanics
* Have a first page where user can input the number of floors and lifts
* On clicking simulate button the floors and lifts will be dynamically generated on the fly
* On clicking a particular button on the floor, lift goes to that floor
* Lift having doors open in 1.5s, then closing in another 1.5s
* Lift moving at 2s per floor
* Lift stopping at every floor where it was called
